Hi, you can directly connect a wishbone slave to avalon bus with the sopc builder. 
As an example, see the integration of i2c core into nios processor: 
1. Within SOPC builder, generate interface to user logic. 
2. Select bus interface type: avalon register slave. 
3. Add "i2c_master_top.v" design file. 
4. Read port list from file. 
5. Connect the signals as follow: 
	wb_adr_i address 
	wb_dat_i writedata 
	wb_dat_o readdata 
	wb_we_i write 
	wb_stb_i chipselect 
	wb_cyc_i chipselect 
	wb_inta_o irq 
	wb_clk_i clk 
	wb_ack_o waitrequest_n 
	wb_rst_i always0 
	
	arst_i reset_n 
	scl_pad_i export 
	scl_pad_o export 
	scl_padoen_o 
	export sda_pad_i 
	export sda_pad_o 
	export sda_padoen_o export 
6. Under timing tab, leave the setup, wait and hold settings at 0 cycles.

Then you create a component, and simply map each port in the component builder to 
the equivalent Avalon signal. The only one that isn't perhaps _immediately_ 
obvious is that ACK <=> waitrequest_n and BTW you map *both* cyc and stb to chipselect 
(and ignore the warning).
